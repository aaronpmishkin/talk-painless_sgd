# talk-painless_sgd

Several variations on the same talk for the [Painless SGD](arxiv.org/abs/1905.09997) paper. The different branches contain different talks:

`master`: Slides from a video for MLSS 2020. The video is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IchhE4JXLE4).

`version/exchange`: Slides from a talk exchange with the [PLAI lab](https://plai.cs.ubc.ca/) at UBC.
